## Project Overview

This project focuses on **user profiling and segmentation** to understand user behaviour and optimize digital advertising strategies.

The goal is to:
- Analyze demographic and behavioural patterns  
- Identify engagement trends  
- Segment users into meaningful clusters  
- Create user personas for targeted ad campaigns  

**Dataset:** `user_profiles_for_ads.csv`

---

## Dataset Features

- Demographics: Age, Gender, Location, Education Level, Income Level  
- Behavioural: Time Spent Online (Weekday/Weekend), Likes & Reactions  
- Advertising Metrics: CTR, Conversion Rate, Ad Interaction Time  
- Device Usage & Top Interests  

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Checked null values and descriptive statistics
- Visualized demographic distributions (Age, Gender, Education, Income)
- Analyzed device usage patterns
- Compared weekday vs weekend activity
- Examined engagement metrics (Likes, CTR, Conversion Rate)
- Identified most common user interests
- Generated correlation matrix to understand metric relationships  

---

## User Segmentation

Applied **K-Means Clustering** on selected behavioural and demographic features to create meaningful audience segments.

Generated cluster summaries using:
- Mean values for numerical features  
- Mode values for categorical features  

---

## Identified User Segments

1️⃣ **Weekend Warriors**  
High weekend activity, moderate engagement, male-dominant, mid-high income  

2️⃣ **Engaged Professionals**  
Balanced activity, highest engagement, high income  

3️⃣ **Low-Key Users**  
Moderate activity, lower CTR, mid income  

4️⃣ **Active Explorers**  
High activity, lower reactions, female-dominant  

5️⃣ **Budget Browsers**  
Moderate activity, lowest engagement, lowest income  

---

## Visualization

Created a **Radar Chart** comparing cluster mean values across key features to visually highlight:

- Engagement levels  
- Online activity  
- Advertising responsiveness  
- Income differences  

---

## Key Insights

- Higher income users show stronger ad engagement and conversion rates.  
- Weekend activity significantly influences engagement behavior.  
- Device usage impacts interaction time with advertisements.  
- Segmentation enables personalized marketing strategies.  

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data profiling and clustering techniques can:

- Improve ad targeting  
- Enhance personalization  
- Increase conversion efficiency  
- Support strategic marketing decisions
