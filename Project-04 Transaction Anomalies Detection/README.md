## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting unusual or fraudulent financial transactions using **Anomaly Detection techniques**.

The goal is to:
- Identify abnormal transaction patterns  
- Detect potential fraudulent activities  
- Analyze transaction behavior across different account types  
- Apply Isolation Forest for anomaly detection  

**Dataset:** `transaction_anomalies_dataset.csv`

---

## Dataset Features

- Transaction_ID  
- Transaction_Amount  
- Transaction_Volume  
- Average_Transaction_Amount  
- Frequency_of_Transactions  
- Time_Since_Last_Transaction  
- Day_of_Week  
- Time_of_Day  
- Age  
- Gender  
- Income  
- Account_Type  

---

## Data Analysis

- Checked null values, column information, and descriptive statistics
- Analyzed distribution of transaction amounts
- Compared transaction amounts by account type
- Evaluated average transaction amount by age
- Counted transactions by day of the week
- Generated correlation matrix to understand feature relationships  

---

## Anomaly Detection Process

- Visualized transaction outliers  
- Calculated anomaly ratio in dataset  
- Selected relevant numerical features  
- Applied **Isolation Forest Algorithm**  
- Converted model predictions into binary labels  
- Evaluated model using classification report  

---

## Results

- Successfully identified anomalous transactions  
- Calculated total anomaly count and anomaly ratio  
- Generated classification report for model evaluation  
- Visualized anomalies within transaction data  

---

## Key Insights

- High transaction amount deviations are strong anomaly indicators  
- Sudden frequency changes contribute to abnormal patterns  
- Certain account types show higher anomaly probability  
- Isolation Forest efficiently detects rare fraudulent behaviors  

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance:

- Fraud detection systems  
- Financial risk monitoring  
- Security-sensitive operations  
- Real-time anomaly identification
